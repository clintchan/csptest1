  <title>Sample Website #1</title>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Website</h1>
    <p>Hello World!  This is my first website.  Yay!
    <p>Here is another paragraph of text.
    <hr>
    <h2>A subsection title here</h2>
    <p>And here is another paragraph.
    Notice that spacing doesn't really matter.
    Everything is printed on one line on the page.
    Even though in the code, these are all separate lines.
    <p>If you want a new line, you need to use another paragraph tag.
    <p>See.
